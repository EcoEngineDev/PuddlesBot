1. Cheddar - A sharp, aged cheese perfect for sandwiches
2. Brie - A creamy, soft cheese with a white rind
3. Gouda - A Dutch cheese with a nutty flavor
4. Mozzarella - Fresh Italian cheese, great for pizza
5. Blue cheese - Strong flavored cheese with blue veins
6. Parmesan - Hard Italian cheese, perfect for grating
7. Swiss - Cheese with distinctive holes, mild flavor
8. Feta - Greek cheese, crumbly and salty
9. Camembert - French cheese similar to brie
10. Manchego - Spanish sheep's milk cheese

Each of these cheeses has unique characteristics and uses in cooking. Would you like more details about any specific cheese?"""
